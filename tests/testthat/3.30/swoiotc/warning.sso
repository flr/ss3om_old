Note that recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
setting in starter does not request all priors, and 99 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
 Minimum size bin is:_15; which is >10cm, which is large for use as size-at-age 0.0 recruitment
 Maximum size at age: 274.298; is within 5% of the largest size bin: 270; Add more bins
Final gradient: 0.000237642 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  14
 N warnings: 21
